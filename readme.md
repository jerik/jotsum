# Nebenrechnung

A simple HTML page for auxiliary calculations
In the auxiliary calculation, text and calculation can be mixed in each line, e.g:

    3 apples + 4 pears

The numbers and calculation operators are extracted from each line and calculated as a subtotal.
All subtotals are added up to the final total.
