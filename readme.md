# jotsum

**jotsum** lets you jot down notes with numbers, and it sums them up instantly.

It is a simple browser-based tool for quick, line-by-line calculations. You can freely mix text and numbers in each line, for example:

```
3 apples + 4 pears
```

The numbers are extracted, calculated as a subtotal, and all subtotals are summed into a final total.

## How it works

* Each line can contain both text and numbers with operators
* Subtotals are calculated per line
* All subtotals are automatically added up

---

## Paste behavior

When you paste multi-line text, each line becomes its own calculation — and the results are instantly updated.
